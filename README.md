# COVID Chatbot

COVID ChatBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine built in Python
which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of known COVID 
information. 

## How it works

1- For this project, you need to install Python 3.8 on your machine

2- Set up the virtual environment: `python3 -m venv virtual-env-name`

3- Install all requirements packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4- To run the application run: `rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug & rasa run actions`

when you see the message "root  - Rasa server is up and running." in the terminal, you can open the browser_demo.html
in your browser. You should be able to see this:
