answer: 26 January 2020

question: What other betacoronaviruses are zoonotic in origin?

question: What viruses are similar to the COVID-19 coronavirus?
answer: MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

question:  Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  and another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease, how does MERS affect the patients?
answer: MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal.

question: What is a key assumption of a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model used for coronavirus?
answer: each intervention has the same effect on the
reproduction number across countries and over time

question: Why is there high uncertainty in estimating the impact of interventions against the coronavirus?
answer: too early to detect substantial
intervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic

question: Why is it statistically impossible to determine which individual intervention had the greatest effect on reducing the coronavirus reproduction number?
answer: close spacing of interventions in time
